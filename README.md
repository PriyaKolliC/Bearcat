## Inspiration
How many times have you wondered in your workspace, "Why is so cold in here?" or "It's so late in the night. Why are the lights still on?" or "I wish the washroom trash was not overflowing"

At all these instances, you would have wanted to tell someone the issue you face. We know we have.

So we built an app to do exactly that.

## What it does
This App is called ScanAway.

Based on a location and type of place, a QR Code is generated for a given location. The app scans the QR Code and allows you to inform the administrators about common energy issues you face.

We have extended this app to include reporting issued faced in a restroom as well.

## How I built it
It is mainly an Android Application. It was built using Android Studio and the Cloud that manages the collected data is on GCP.

Programmed in Java, XML for the app and Python Flask for the server side operations.

## Challenges I ran into
We struggled to settle on a single idea.

Sending the data to the Cloud in a JSON format. Dynamically inserting data to the app.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being able to build and deploy an application in a short amount of time available.

## What I learned
Learned to make an Android App. Connecting Android to the Cloud.

## What's next for ScanAway
Data Visualization from collected data to make it easy for reducing the complaints Badges of recognition for students who are responsible enough to report the issues on a regular basis.
